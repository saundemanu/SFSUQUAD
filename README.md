The "SFSU QUAD" project was a web application created to facilitate safe buying and selling of various items and services for San Francisco State University (SFSU) students. It was designed with the intention of providing a platform similar to popular online marketplaces like eBay or Craigslist, but with a specific focus on the SFSU student community.

Key features and details of the project include:

Target Audience:

SFSU Students: The primary users of the platform were students from San Francisco State University.
Functionality:

Buy/Sell Platform: Users could post listings for items they wanted to sell and browse listings of items available for purchase.
Categories: The platform likely supported categorization of listings, allowing users to easily find items of interest (e.g., books, electronics, services).
Authentication: Access to buying and selling functionality required users to have a valid SFSU email address, which helped establish a trusted community within the platform.
Technology Stack:

LAMP Stack: The project was deployed on a server configured with a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack, which is a common web application development environment.
Flask Framework: Flask is a lightweight and flexible micro web framework for Python. It likely handled routing, request handling, and potentially other server-side tasks.
MySQL Database: MySQL was used as the database management system to store and manage data related to users, listings, and other application components.
Google Cloud Compute: This platform was used to host and serve the application to users.
Deployment Date:

The project was deployed in December 2019. However, it appears to have been available for a limited period of time.
Documentation:

The project included comprehensive documentation, which encompassed various aspects of the development process. This documentation likely included:
Design Specifications: Detailed plans and blueprints outlining the architecture, features, and user interface of the application.
Use Cases: Scenarios or stories that described how users would interact with the platform, helping to identify functionality and user flows.
Development Resources: Information and references that developers could use during the development process, such as APIs, libraries, or frameworks.
Screenshots: Visual representations of different sections of the application to provide an overview of the user interface.
Milestones:

Milestones serve as significant checkpoints or achievements in the development process. They may include specific features, improvements, or bug fixes that were completed at different stages of the project.
Project Scope:

The project was focused on providing a localized, secure, and convenient platform for SFSU students to engage in buying and selling activities. By requiring SFSU email addresses for access, the platform aimed to establish a trusted community among its users.
Overall, "SFSU QUAD" was a well-documented project that aimed to address a specific need within the SFSU student community by providing a safe and convenient platform for buying and selling items and services. It leveraged a LAMP stack, Flask framework, MySQL database, and Google Cloud Compute for deployment. While it was active for a limited time, it represented a valuable resource for students during its availability.
