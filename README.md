# SFSU QUAD

### SFSU QUAD: http://sfsuquad.com/ (depreciated) 

**SFSU QUAD** was a Buy/Sell Website designed for SFSU students to safely purchase and sell their books, electronics, and services; the service was intended to be similar to that of ebay or craigslist yet required users to have SFSU emails to access buying/selling functionality. 

The project was deployed via a LAMP stack using the Flask framework, MySQL and Google Cloud Compute to host. 

The service deployed in December 2019 for a short period of time and documentation including design specifications, use cases, development resources, and screenshots can be found via the milestones.
