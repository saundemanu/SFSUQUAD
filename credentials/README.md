# Credentials Folder

## The purpose of this folder is to store all credentials needed to log into your server and databases. This is important for many reasons. But the two most important reasons is
    1. Grading , servers and databases will be logged into to check code and functionality of application. Not changes will be unless directed and coordinated with the team.
    2. Help. If a class TA or class CTO needs to help a team with an issue, this folder will help facilitate this giving the TA or CTO all needed info AND instructions for logging into your team's server. 


# Below is a list of items required. Missing items will causes points to be deducted from multiple milestone submissions.

1. Server URL or IP: http://sfsuquad.com OR http://34.66.133.23
2. SSH username 3. SSH password or key
    ## How to SSH our server
    1. Open incognito tab in Google Chrome
    2. Log in into Google account using following credentials: 
    
            email: csc648.02@gmail.com
            pass:  2019team08
        
    3. Go to https://cloud.google.com/
    4. Press 'Console' button on the top right corner
    5. Once you're in a console, go to 'Compute Engine' and you should see our instance with 34.66.133.23 IP
    6. Press 'SSH' button 
    
4. Database URL or IP and port used: DB is hosted on the server using the default ports
    <br><strong> NOTE THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR DATABASE NEEDS A PUBLIC FACING PORT.</strong> But knowing the IP and port number will help with SSH tunneling into the database. The default port is more than sufficient for this class.
5. Database username (for now): root
6. Database password (for now): password
7. Database name (basically the name that contains all your tables): prototypedb
8. Instructions on how to use the above information.

# Most important things to Remember
## These values need to kept update to date throughout the semester. <br>
## <strong>Failure to do so will result it points be deducted from milestone submissions.</strong><br>
## You may store the most of the above in this README.md file. DO NOT Store the SSH key or any keys in this README.md file.
